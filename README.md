Personality Type Prediction using Myers-Briggs Type Indicator

Introduction

Understanding personality type can be used in a variety of ways. Personality type can help identifying people's preferences, as well as how and why they differ. Personality types can help sociologist and businesses to understand how people lead, influence, communicate, collaborate, negotiate business, and cope with difficult situations. (Mosley, 2016) Personality is defined as the characteristic sets of behaviors, cognitions, and emotional patterns that evolve from biological and environmental factors which make a person unique. (The Cambridge handbook of personality psychology, 2009) Many models of personality assessment, such as Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) (Myers–Briggs Type Indicator, n.d.), DISC Assessment (DISC assessment, n.d.), Big Five Personality Traits (Big Five personality traits, n.d.), etc., are available and a variety of businesses use such testing to make critical choices. The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, or MBTI, is one of the most well-known of these personality tests. The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) personality test was created to make C. G. Jung's idea of psychological types more understandable and relevant in people's lives. The idea states that much of what appears to be random variance in behavior, is quite regular and consistent, due to fundamental variations in how people prefer to use their perception and judgment. (The Myers & Briggs Foundation - - MBTI® Basics, n.d.) MBTI categorizes people into 16 different personality types. The test categorizes you along four axes. Each describes a way of seeing or dealing with the world. For example, an INFP person is an Introvert rather than an Extrovert who trusts intuition (N) over facts and Sensing (S). The person is emotional (Feeling) rather than analytical (Thinking), and prefers to go with the flow (Perceiving) over having a highly structured and decided life (Judging). (Myers–Briggs Type Indicator, n.d.) • INFP: introversion (I), intuition (N), feeling (F), perception (P) • ESTJ: extraversion (E), sensing (S), thinking (T), judgment (J)

On the other hand, everyday millions of people are using social networks to get access to news, trends and express their ideas. Twitter is one of the most popular social networks with a more focus on text-based communication. It is the platform users go to see what is going on in the world and to engage in the debate about it. Users’ tweets can be used to predict what type of personality they have based on their on-platform tweets and regions. In this research the goal is to know personality type of Twitter users base on their tweets and the place where the tweet was originated. This categorization can be a useful tool for analyzing career paths, job satisfaction, preferences in various programs and websites, and positioning product and services. To answer this question, the Myers-Briggs Personality Type Dataset, collected through the PersonalityCafe (Personality Cafe, n.d.) forum and publicly available on the Kaggle website (J, n.d.), was used to develop a machine learning model to predict users’ personality type. The Tweet Archives were fed into this model to predict each user's personality type.
